# mlb-cliptool

simple utility to query MLB API for clips and then automatically download them.

### usage

at the moment, i haven't added any sort of UI to this - graphical or otherwise.

therefore, if you wanna give this a try, you'll have to make changes directly to the `get_clips` method call, switching up the params.
